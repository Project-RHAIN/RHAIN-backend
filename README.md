# RHAIN-backend

1. Install Docker and docker-compose in your system

(If you are running windows you will have to install WSL 2 to run docker through WSL)

2. Navigate to the RHAIN-backend folder

3. Run the container

If you are running it for the first time, run this:

```
docker-compose up --build
```
Otherwise, do it without the build:
